# Ariadne

**Ariadne** is a sophisticated Chrome extension designed to restructure browsing history into a coherent hierarchical visualization. By leveraging the native `referringVisitId` from the Chrome History API, Ariadne reconstructs the user's navigational path in a tree format, providing context often lost in traditional linear history views.

## Core Capabilities

### Hierarchical Visualization
Unlike standard history lists, Ariadne identifies and displays the parent-child relationships between visited pages. This allows users to trace their investigative flows (e.g., Search Engine → Result → Sub-page) with visual clarity.

### Temporal Segmentation
Browsing activity is automatically categorized into distinct chronological buckets:
*   **Today**
*   **Yesterday**
*   **Last 7 Days**
*   **Older**

This temporal grouping, combined with sticky section headers, ensures efficient navigation through extensive history logs.

### Privacy-Centric Architecture
Ariadne operates with a strict "privacy-by-design" philosophy.
*   **No Content Injection**: The extension does not inject scripts into web pages.
*   **Native API Usage**: It relies exclusively on the `chrome.history` API to read existing data.
*   **Local Processing**: All logic runs locally within the client; no browsing data is transmitted to external servers.

### Modern Interface
The user interface features a simplified, glassmorphic design utilizing the Inter typeface and interactive DOM elements (folding trees, hover states) to enhance usability without sacrificing performance.

## Installation and Build
